# Colophon

This blog is created with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/). All notebooks are exported to Markdown on commit using a [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) [hook](https://github.com/ezixi/analysis/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L15). It uses an adapted version of the [Jekyll Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).
