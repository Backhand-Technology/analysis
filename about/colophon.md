# Colophon

This blog is created with [Github Pages]([https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and [Jupyter Lab]([https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/)). All notebooks are exported to Markdown on commit using a [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) [hook](https://github.com/ezixi/analysis/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml#L15). It uses an adapted version of the [Jekyll Cayman theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman).

Version control is more important than an overblown feature set, and I didnâ€™t need to manage a db or server; I needed a simple space where I could prepare some analyses and push them to the web as easily as possible, with code intact. I like to potter about in Jupyter notebooks and having a simple route from working locally to pushing live was a big benefit.
