# Colophon

This blog is created with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as I required a simple place I could prepare some analyses and have them pushed to the web as easily as possible, with code intact.
I like to potter about in [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/), and having a simple route from working locally to pusing live was a big benefit.
