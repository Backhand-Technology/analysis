# Voyager

In 2008 something extraordinary happened.

Far, far away, - further than anything made by humans had ever been before - a smallish chunk of metal and plastic moved through a barrier. It could have been ingnored; nothing really changed, no walls were torn down, no gates were opened, no tickets were stamped. But it was something to be noted nonetheless.

In fact, it was something that teams of scientists had been expecting, even hoping for for some time. They even thought it had already happened.

This is very much a WIP, but I'm interested in how we define 'the edge of the solar system' - it's actually a trickier question than you might think.

 I've started exploring some data from the [Voyager 2 Plasma Experiment](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft/instruments/pls/) in a Jupyter Notebook.
