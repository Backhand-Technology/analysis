# Understanding Your Data Is In Every Employee's Job Description.

There was a moment, in the not so distant past, when companies would employ a data team. It might have been known by other names - ‘Business Intelligence’ maybe, or  ‘Analytics’ - but each team was pretty much the same; a small collection of the random people in the org who knew what a pivot table was.

For many organizations the data team would be part of the finance group. On the face of it this was because that team had the most to lose if anyone lost track of where all the money was; in reality it was just a natural consequence of a bunch of Excel geeks hanging out together, like basic life spontaneously organizing around deep-sea hot springs.

These were the people who could ‘build a report’ for the CFO, ‘crunch some numbers’ to ‘get a deck together’ for a sale presentation, or ‘work til midnight three nights on the run so the CEO can speak with confidence to the board on an important subject they really should have no business talking about’. They were where the data _lived_.

As time went on, these data teams would get more sophisticated;  they would collect data in a single place so it could be reused, model it, move it, aggregate it, ensure its quality. They would own it.

In fact, they would have so much ownership over the data that _no one else in the company could have anything to do with it._

Sales couldn’t pull a sales report. Marketing wouldn’t know how well the latest campaign had done. Instead, they’d get a monthly, or weekly if they were lucky, puke of data in their inbox and be left to fight over which team had the right numbers. It was messy, and it was tragic.


## Your Data Was Messy and Tragic

It was messy because having multiple sources of data in different places meant that no-one could ever agree on what that data might mean.

It was tragic because not knowing what data means and how it affected your job meant that you couldn’t _do_ your job, or at least you couldn’t do it as well as you would like.

Now there are plenty of opportunities

everyone in a business organization in the 21st century needs to understand the company’s data. They need to not only know what data they produce, consume and change, but also how that data fits into the bigger picture.
