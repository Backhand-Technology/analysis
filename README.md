## Our Principles
<h3><a href="/Principles/data_quality.html">Data Quality Is Paramount</a></h3>
Data quality underpins everything we do. Well-designed, fast analytics systems using the shiniest of new technologies are worse than useless if the data that moves through them isn’t an accurate representation of reality. A commitment to good design, testing, and monitoring at every level not only ensures that your insights are real and useful, but also allows you to move faster and add value. <a href="/Principles/data_quality.html">>></a>

We believe that working with data shouldn't be limited to data teams and analysts; understanding data should be in every employee’s job description. <a href="/Principles/understanding_your_data_is_in_every_employees_job_description.html">>></a>
