## Our Principles
<h3><a href="http://analysis.backhand.tech/Principles/data_quality.html">Data Quality Is Paramount</a></h3>
Data quality underpins everything we do. Well-designed, fast analytics systems using the shiniest of new technologies are worse than useless if the data that moves through them isn’t an accurate representation of reality. A commitment to good design, testing, and monitoring at every level not only ensures that your insights are real and useful, but also allows you to move faster and add value. <a href="http://analysis.backhand.tech/Principles/data_quality.html">>></a>
