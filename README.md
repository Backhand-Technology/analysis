# About Backhand Technology

Backhand Technology is a Data Engineering and Analytics Consultancy founded by Martin Bell.

[Read more about me and Backhand Technology](http://www.backhand.tech)

[Get in touch](mailto:martin@backhand.tech) if I can help you define and implement new data pipelines and infrastructure, perform analysis, or build data visualisations that provide insight to your business.

This is the home of any data focused analysis and blogging that interests me; some is complete, sometimes I just throw things here while I think about them, so make of that what you will.

### Current Projects

1. [Voyager 2 Plasma Experiment](http://analysis.backhand.tech/voyager/solar_wind)

    This is very much a WIP, but I'm interested in how we define 'the edge of the solar system' - it's actually a trickier question than you might think. I've started exploring some data from the [Voyager 2 Plasma Experiment](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft/instruments/pls/) in a Jupyter Notebook.
