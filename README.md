## Hi, I'm Martin Bell

I help people use data to improve their business.

[Get in touch](mailto:martin@backhandmedia.com) if I can help you with any aspect of data engineering or analytics.

### About Backhand Media

Backhand Media is a collective term for the various work I publish online (cos it's all about the brand with the kids these days, right?); I collect various technology stories  - mainly focusing on data engineering - at [blog.backhandmedia.com](https://blog.backhandmedia.com), I publish flash fiction at [Backhand Stories](https://www.backhandstories.com), and this is the home of any data focused analysis and blogging I might like to do.
