## Hi, I'm Martin Bell

I help people use data to improve their business.

[Get in touch](mailto:martin@backhand.tech) if I can help you with any aspect of data engineering or analytics.

### About Backhand Technology

Backhand Technology is a collective term for the various work I publish online ; I collect various technology stories  - mainly focusing on data engineering - at [blog.backhandmedia.com](https://blog.backhandmedia.com), I publish flash fiction at [Backhand Stories](https://www.backhandstories.com), and this is the home of any data focused analysis and blogging I might like to do.

### Current Projects

1. [Voyager 2 Plasma Experiment](http://analysis.backhandmedia.com/voyager/solar_wind)

    This is very much a WIP, but I'm interested in how we define 'the edge of the solar system' - it's actually a trickier question than you might think. I've started exploring some data from the [Voyager 2 Plasma Experiment](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/spacecraft/instruments/pls/) in a Jupyter Notebook.
